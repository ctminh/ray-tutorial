    The input points will be [x,y,z]. For plotting, we clip z to be no larger
    than max_cell_age. That affects how many colors are chosen from the specified
    color palette. A smaller value of max_cell_size produces faster changes, since
    most lifetimes are low, except for large game sizes, where some patterns can
    be semi-permanent. If use_fixed_cell_sizes=False, then the points grow in size
    from zero (dead) to the clipped size. The log(z)+1 is calculated as an alternative
    for mapping to colors and sizes, but it doesn't work that well for small
    lifetimes. See comment below inline.
